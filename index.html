          <p>Having a busy schedule at school and struggling to wake up most mornings, I created a television alarm with a raspberry pi computer to help me be better organized.

It prompted me to wake up with a basic text to speech module, and gave me time to see what I had going on for the day before it shut itself down. I still use this device every day.</p><p>Tech used: Python, Raspberry Pi, cec-client, Google Calendar api, Cron, HTML, CSS</p>

        <h3>Fantasy Sports Lineup Generator</h3>
        <div id="subtitle">Fall 2016</div>
        <div id="location"></div>
          <p>Being an avid football fan and sports fan in general, I decided to create a script to generate lineups for daily fantasy sports. In daily fantasy sports, you create a lineup of players that you believe will do well, all while staying under a fixed budget. This is a classic knapsack problem in CS, as each player is given a weight. Using BeautifulSoup to scrape multiple sports websites, I compiled a list of statistics for each player over the past couple weeks. Taking these stats as well as using my own judgement, I was able to project how each player will do for that given day. I then was able to run these projections through an AI algorithm found online, generating 5 optimal lineups. This program ended up doing quite well versus the average player, as it had a 65% success rate in the 50/50 contests.</p><p>Tech used: Python, BeautifulSoup, Genetic Algorithm</p>

          <p>Being an avid football fan and sports fan in general, I decided to create a script to generate lineups for daily fantasy sports. In daily fantasy sports, you create a lineup of players that you believe will do well, all while staying under a fixed budget. This is a classic knapsack problem in CS, as each player is given a weight.
